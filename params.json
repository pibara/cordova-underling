This is great, but if you are a JavaScript\r\ndeveloper who wants to check out Cordova, you will need to do quite a bit of work before you can\r\nstart playing around with the Apache Cordova JavaScript APIs. Lets take Android as an example to see\r\nwhat you will need to do to 'start' playing with the Cordova API using your Android phone:\r\n\r\n1. Install the Eclipse IDE\r\n2. Install the Android SDK\r\n3. Install the ADT plugin for Eclipse\r\n4. Download Apache Cordova\r\n5. Create an Android project in Eclipse.\r\n6. Move some Cordova files to your android project directory tree.\r\n7. Write some HTML/JavaScript that uses the Cordova API\r\n8. Build an APK \r\n9. Deploy the APK to your phone\r\n10. Run the application on your phone.\r\n11. If you need to tune anything, change your files and repeat steps 8/9/10. \r\n\r\nCordova Underling is a simple Cordova App that makes your first encounter with the \r\nCordova API a much less time consuming process. If you will want to write real applications \r\nyou shall need to take all steps above, but while still just exploring the Cordova API, \r\nUnderling will help you get started a bit faster.\r\n\r\n1. Install Cordova Underling on your phone from Android Play\r\n2. Write some HTML/JavaScript that uses the Cordova API\r\n3. Upload your HTML/Javascript to a web server.\r\n4. Start Underling and point it to your Apps web URL.\r\n5. Press the Underling button to start your Cordova App.\r\n6. If you need to tune anything, change your files and repeat steps 3 and 5.\r\n\r\nBasically this should help you get started playing around with Cordova faster.\r\nMaybe you find out that Cordova isn't what you need, and you won't have had to spent\r\nhours getting the Android development environment up and running. Maybe you find out\r\nCordova is just right for you, and you will only have to install the development \r\nenvironment as last step (for creating and publishing your App) after you've completed \r\nand tested your App using Underling.","tagline":"Source of the Cordova Underling tool","google":"","name":"Cordova-underling"}
